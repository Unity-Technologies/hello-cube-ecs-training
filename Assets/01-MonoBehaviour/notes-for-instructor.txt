01-MonoBehaviour can be considered the starting point with all of the
code already completed.  It should be sufficient just to go over the
code and show how the cubes are spawned and how they rotate.

The real point of this scene is to show the performance of it in play
mode.  On my MacBook Pro (2018) it runs at about 66 ms per frame and
is CPU bound.  Going into the profiler and showing where time is being
spent, particularly in BehaviourUpdate with 10,000 instances of
RotatingCube.Update() will set the baseline for the rest of this
exercise.

This is the first time the usage of DOTS will be illustrated through
code.  This project already has the following preview packages
installed:

Entities
Hybrid Renderer

However, you should be sure to have it uninstalled when you start
looking at 01-MonoBehaviour so that when you get to this part, you can
show how to install the packages to get started with DOTS.
